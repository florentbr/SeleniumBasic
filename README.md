# SeleniumBasic
A Selenium based browser automation framework for VB.Net, Visual Basic Applications and VBScript.
This repository made modifications to the Driver Library path based on the Floren (original author)'s suggestion: https://gist.github.com/florentbr/6be960752fc852ee99eece6b4acb8ba7

In order to rebuild the binary exe file: 
1. First obtain/update the reference files in the References folder. If the files are missing, try to extract them from the original build (by Floren) and put them there.
2. Execute build-setup.py. Make sure that the softwares mentioned in the file are installed.
3. Finally execute SeleniumBasicSetup.iss.
